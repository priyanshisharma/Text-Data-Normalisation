Amazon
Recruiter for International Hiring
January 2015 - June 2016 (1 year 6 months)
Hyderabad Area, India

At Amazon, I was a part of the Consumer Recruiting Event Sourcing Team
(CREST). This team works in an Event Recruiting Model. I hired for Senior
Technical/Non-Technical roles from all over the world for various teams based
primary in Seattle and other Amazon offices present in other regions of the
world.


As a Recruiter, my primary responsibility was the Talent Sourcing part for an
event based hiring model. It involved collaboration with international business
teams as well as recruiting teams to ensure that the event is a success by
lining up the best of the talent by sourcing/screening the best available talent.
All this was done in a global environment.
Candidate engagement combined with focused sourcing efforts were the
key skills which came to use during this role. Although the candidates were
in different countries, handholding them at each stage for regular updates
and ensuring that the overall hiring process is a positive experience, was the
objective behind the efforts.

Hyderabad Area, India

                                    Page 2 of 4
This role was my first step in the recruiting world and got to work in different
roles and got exposure to different aspects of the recruiting cycle.


For the initial period, i was working as a staffing associate where my main
responsibility was to ensure candidate engagement and take them through the
interview loop and ensure good external stakeholder management.
I also worked as a Talent Sourcer, where I was responsible for hiring for
various skills and levels by sourcing candidates through various channels and
ensuring that the business meets the hiring targets well on time.
During the later part of my time in this role, I also took some additional
responsibilites as the Staffing Consultant, where I worked as the interface
between the business and the staffing team. This involved working with
different teams to finalise the hiring plan and working with the extended team
to ensure that the hiring plan is executed well on time.


Apart from this, got an opportunity to work for international hiring while
Global Delivery was expanding in LATAM, EMEA and Asia. This gave me
an experience of working with virtual teams and got to improve my Program
Management skills. I received an award for this assignment.
I was also working as the lead for the ATS for Global Delivery. This role was
about ensuring that the team is compliant in the process to be followed and
meets all the metrics successfully.

Since the day I joined MDI, I have seen myself changing from the
scratch, with responsibilities and team work succeeding the list. And
with each moment passing by, I have learnt to appreciate people,
since everyone contributes to all new perspectives that we get to
know about life.


Along with academics, I strongly believe that a person should excel
in every event of their life. Be it sports, be it extra curricular or any
other field. For me, sports has been an integral part in the learning
process since my school days and even now. It teaches you team
work, team co-ordination, leadership and management skills with
such simple examples that one need not go deep into the roots of
those words.
